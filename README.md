# Get Things Done (get-things-done)

As a linux user, I want a time tracking software that runs native and locally in Mac OS X, that it doesn't require access to the internet to work properly, that works as simple as possible and shows results of the tracked activities clearly.

Time ago I've been working with Get Things GNOME! as my personal time tracking software, I found it's features very complete, easy to use, consistent abut simple. Once I switched from Linux to Mac, I couldn't found a software as good as GTG for free and not internet based.

This project tries to mimic GTG features for Mac OS X.
