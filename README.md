# Get Things Done (get-things-done)

As a linux user, I want a time tracking software that runs native and locally in Mac OS X, that it doesn't require an Internet access to work properly, that works as simple as possible and shows results of the tracked activities clearly.

Time ago I've been working with Get Things GNOME! as my personal time tracking software, I found its features very complete, easy to use, consistent but simple. Once I switched from Linux to Mac, I couldn't found a software as good as GTG for free and not Web based.

This project tries to mimic GTG features for Mac OS X.


# To-Do

- Automate the process of creating the database schema on the first run after distribution
- On the Task Details window, implement edition of dates; currently the table displaying the details of a task by day or dates is enable for edition but the Save button doesn't have the associated action.
